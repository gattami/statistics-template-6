### 
Among men aged 18-22 living in big cities with high financial stress, the depression rate reaches nearly 73%.
For men over 31 in the same situation, it's 41%.  
That's almost twice as high among the younger group.

The trend is clear across both charts and tables:  
Depression decreases with age  
It increases with financial stress  
Bigger city environments seem to amplify the effect

The gap between younger and older people is actually larger than the difference between small and big cities.  
That suggests age is a stronger factor than location.

Both men and women follow the same pattern:  
The more financial stress, the higher the depression rates  
The older the group, the lower the rates  
But women consistently report slightly higher levels than men, no matter the city size or stress level.

Looking at financial stress level 5:  
Women in big cities: nearly 84% report depression  
Men in big cities: just over 72%

All groups are heavily affected by financial stress.
